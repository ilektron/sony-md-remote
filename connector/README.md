# Sony Minidisc 3.5mm Male TRS + 4pin edge connector

## PCB

The connector seems to be about 1.4mm thick, which is thinner than the standard 1.6mm PCB. PCBWay has an option for a 1.2mm PCB with edge connectors. Since the actual conductor pads are recessed, 1.2 with an ENIG finish should fit within the opening for the connector without causing damage.
